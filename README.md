# little-web-server
Tried to build litlle web-server, which is supposed render some simple HTML/CSS/JS, written in go.

I had some issues with getting the CSS/JS rendered, this little blog entry helped me to make it work: https://dazspace.codes/blog/How+to+render+CSS+in+a+Golang+server-2021-October-10
